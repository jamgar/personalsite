        Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am James Garcia.

        I have been in tech in some form of capacity for over 10 years. 
        Still learning and still loving it. 
        I am grateful to have been in this field because it has provided 
        for me and my family. While I don't work as a full-time Rails 
        developer I have created a Rails app Sharedwise. It is a blogging 
        platform where a user creates a "Collection", which is basically an 
        organizational unit, and then create post under the collection 
        that are of a similar topic. People have different interest and so 
        this will help them to have different collections based on those interest.
